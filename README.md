# SplitViewEverywhere
## Enable SplitView/SlideOver on unsupported apps on iPadOS!

On stock iPadOS, apple has limited the SplitView/SlideOver feature for apps like Settings.
This tweak breaks that limitation and allows you to use the iPad as it's meant to be used.
Watching Netflix while chatting on Discord was not possible before, now it is.

There are no options to configure.
